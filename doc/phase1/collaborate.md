# Collaborate
#### Goal
We wish to develop individual skills for each member of the team as well as large group working skills. As a team we have a combined 2 years of software engineering work experience. We have some experience working on a microservice architecture but little to none on designing scalable systems.

#### Team's competencies
| Name  | Competency | Goals |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Abrar Hussain  | Familiar with Nodejs, Golang, React, and designing microservices | Learn more about system design and dividing work among teammates. |
| Pratiman Shahi  | Experience in various older back-end frameworks such as Rails, Node, Spring and PHP. | Explore front-end frameworks such as React and gain expertise in responsiveness | 
| Vanshil Shah | Experience with Golang, React, Git | Learn more about robust development setups including continuous integration, microservices, dockerization |
| Calvin Sanghera | Have experience with React | Gain experience in designing applications in a team. |
| Jesse Cordeiro | Experience with full-stack web development (Java, JavaScript, Spring, Node.js, React) | Learn about microservices and deploying applications with docker/kubernetes. |
| Lucas Luna Souza | Experience with Node and Spring backend, React and Angular frontend | Learn more about backend development and gain experience working in a large team |
| David Ansermino | Experience with Nodejs, React, Express | Improve my development style and process |

#### Meetings
 [Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11KywDZvgnB0173N0azsQsb76SNzHCnqn_jDmkPnBvWM/edit)
 
#### Shared Documents
We initially write and review documents on Google Docs. When design documents are completed, a link is included to the document on Github. The team Github wiki includes all setup and instructional material.

#### Kanban and Meeting Logistics
Github Projects are used for Kanban. This involves using Github milestones, projects, and issues. Milestones will be used for keeping track of overarching goals. Issues will add new requirements and bugs-to-fix as they come up. While the Kanban board will be used to keep track of issues in different states. The tickets will be generated in the To-Do column of the Github issues, which would act like a backlog . The tasks would also be measured by the hours required to complete it. 

We are following the Kanban methodology, hence there won’t be any emphasis on sprints but rather iterative and continual implementation and improvement. Pratiman will be the scrum master and Abrar will be the product owner. To avoid conflicts in scheduling meeting, there will be online meetings taking place twice a week (Tuesday and Saturdays). To deal with the issue of timing conflicts, a vote was taken in the beginning of the semester to decide on two different times during the week and is expected to be available for everybody on the team. 

#### Github/Git
Our team will make use of code reviews to ensure that we prevent any bad code from being pushed into our master branch. In addition to this, we will take advantage of branching to ensure that everyone is working on their own features/fixes without merge conflicts. When a user has completed their task and committed their changes, they will open a pull-request to merge into master. When the PR is opened, Travis-CI will run our test suite against their changes to ensure the individual’s code hasn’t broken our application; this ensures that we aren’t pushing broken code to production.

#### Work Division
**Frontend:** David, Calvin, Abrar, and Pratiman

**User Service:** Jesse and David

**Ticket Service:** Lucas and Jesse

**GAPF Service:** Vanshil and Abrar

**API Gateway:** Abrar will setup the original service. Everyone will be responsible for adding their own APIs to the API gateway.

**Repo Man:** Everyone will be responsible for handling merge conflicts related to their own pull requests.

**TDD Person:** Everyone will write their own test cases.

**CI Person:** Everyone is responsible for ensuring that their code changes pass continuous integration tests.

#### Messaging
We will be using Slack as the team’s messaging platform since this offers us with the ability to have multiple channels of communications among different teams (i.e. frontend vs. backend). Discord will be used to communicate with our team lead/TA, Landy

#### Tracking Progress
We will use burndown charts for tracking our progress, which is also included in the GitHub Milestones.
