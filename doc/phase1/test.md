# Test
Everyone will write tests for their own code (backend). We will not be writing tests for the frontend. Tests will use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). We will use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) in order to run tests on every pull request. Team members are expected to run local tests before submitting a pull request. We will only be writing unit tests. There are no integration or end-to-end tests.
